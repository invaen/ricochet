<objective>
Implement custom payload file loading for the injection engine

Purpose: Enable users to provide their own payload files (SecLists, Wfuzz wordlists, custom payloads) for injection, with {{CALLBACK}} placeholder substitution for correlation tracking.

Output: Working `ricochet inject --payloads payloads.txt` option that injects each payload from the file.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create payload loading module</name>
  <files>ricochet/injection/payloads.py</files>
  <action>
Create `ricochet/injection/payloads.py` with:

1. **load_payloads(filepath: Path) -> list[str]:**
   - Open file with encoding='utf-8'
   - Read line by line
   - Strip only trailing newlines (rstrip('\n\r'))
   - Skip lines starting with # (comments)
   - Skip empty lines
   - Return list of payload strings

2. **load_payloads_streaming(filepath: Path) -> Iterator[str]:**
   - Generator version for large files
   - Same filtering logic as load_payloads
   - Yields payloads one at a time

Include docstrings documenting:
- File format (one payload per line, # for comments, blank lines skipped)
- Raises FileNotFoundError if file doesn't exist
- Raises UnicodeDecodeError if file isn't valid UTF-8
- Compatible with SecLists, Wfuzz, and standard wordlist formats

Use imports:
- `from pathlib import Path`
- `from typing import Iterator`

cd /Users/aidan/projects/security/ricochet
python -c "from ricochet.injection.payloads import load_payloads, load_payloads_streaming; print('Imports OK')"

  <done>Payload loading module exists with both load_payloads and load_payloads_streaming functions</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add --payloads flag to inject command</name>
  <files>ricochet/cli.py, ricochet/injection/__init__.py</files>
  <action>
1. **Update ricochet/injection/__init__.py:**
   - Add import: `from ricochet.injection.payloads import load_payloads, load_payloads_streaming`
   - Add to __all__: "load_payloads", "load_payloads_streaming"

2. **Update ricochet/cli.py inject_parser:**
   Add after existing --payload argument:
   - `--payloads` with type=Path
   - Help text: 'File containing payloads (one per line, # for comments)'

3. **Update cmd_inject function:**
   After creating the injector, add payload loading logic:
   - If args.payloads is provided:
     - Check file exists, return 2 if not
     - Load payloads using load_payloads (lazy import)
     - Handle UnicodeDecodeError, return 2
     - Warn and return 0 if no payloads found
     - Print count of loaded payloads
   - Else: use [args.payload] as single-element list

   Modify injection loop to iterate over payloads list:
   - For --param mode: find matching vector, inject each payload into it
   - For all-vectors mode: inject each payload into all vectors
   - Collect all results into all_results list
   - Use all_results for display

This maintains backward compatibility with single --payload flag.

  <name>Task 3: End-to-end payload file verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Test payload loading and injection with a sample payload file:

1. Create test payload file with comments, blanks, and real payloads
2. Test load_payloads correctly filters comments and blanks
3. Test dry-run injection with --payloads shows multiple injections
4. Verify each injection gets unique correlation ID
5. Verify {{CALLBACK}} placeholder is substituted in each payload
6. Test with specific --param to verify targeting works with multiple payloads
7. Clean up test files

```bash
cd /Users/aidan/projects/security/ricochet
echo -e "# Comment\npayload1\npayload2\n\npayload3" > /tmp/test-payloads.txt
python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from ricochet.injection.payloads import load_payloads
payloads = load_payloads(Path('/tmp/test-payloads.txt'))

assert payloads == ['payload1', 'payload2', 'payload3'], f'Wrong payloads: {payloads}'
print('Payload loading verified: comments and blanks correctly skipped')

1. `python -m ricochet inject --help` shows --payloads option
2. `python -c "from ricochet.injection.payloads import load_payloads"` imports without error
3. load_payloads correctly skips # comments and blank lines
4. Dry-run with --payloads file shows multiple injections with unique correlation IDs
5. Each payload gets {{CALLBACK}} substituted with correlation URL
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User can run `ricochet inject --payloads payloads.txt` and inject all payloads
- Comments (# prefix) and blank lines in payload files are skipped
- Each payload injection gets a unique correlation ID
- {{CALLBACK}} placeholder is substituted in each payload
- Backward compatible: single --payload still works
- load_payloads exported from ricochet.injection module
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-crawler-payloads/05-02-SUMMARY.md`
